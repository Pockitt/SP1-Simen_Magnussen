        Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down
        to our museum, there's plenty to see and do. You can learn about
        Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time
        and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be
        accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn
        and explore. We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week
        on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll get to explore and
        experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we run
        special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go
        on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.
        To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a
        message.

        As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
        places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
        students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
        laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
        inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more about
        our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for
        a visit.
