    <h2>Cosmology</h2>
    <p>
      Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, "The Sky
      Above Us", explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the
      universe around us. We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies
      that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
      stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from
      early Arab traders, to Galileo's telescope, to the latest exploration of
      the planets in our solar system.
