# Description

Homepage for a local Science museum, focused on young minds, but also appealing to adults.
I went for a design I think would appeal to "Young Sheldon", not a super colorful design.
Deeper colors stimulate deeper thinking, color theory says, so I went with dark blue, black, and some dark grey.
