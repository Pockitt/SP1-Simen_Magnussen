        Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to
        making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history,
        science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water,
        and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very
        building blocks of life itself. The aim of our museum is to create a
        space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and
        perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of
        the world around us. We believe science should not be confined to the
        textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over
        1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
        explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with
        and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
        exhibits - they only come to life at night when everyone's gone home).
